A JavaScript user script for exporting products from a preloaded portion of the Ozon catalog to JSON and Markdown files.

The script adds an "Export" button in the bottom right corner of the Ozon catalog page. Clicking it exports all currently loaded products on the page, which are then downloaded as JSON and Markdown files. In both files, each product includes its name, price, link, rating, and number of reviews.

**The script is in alpha stage and may produce errors.**

## Installation

1. Install the [Violentmonkey extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) or a similar alternative.
2. Open the script link from [GitHub](https://github.com/RushanM/Ozon-Catalog-Exporter/raw/refs/heads/master/ozon-catalog-exporter.user.js) or [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/558509-ozon-catalog-exporter).
3. Install the script.
4. Refresh the Ozon catalog page if it was already open.
5. Done!
